# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

I was tasked with creating a Node.js app that generates an SVG file of a simple logo using inquiries that collects data from the user.

## Installation

I used Node.js and Inquirer along with Jest for testing.

## Usage

When a user opens the directory in their command line, they would install Inquirer then use Node.js on the index.js file. This would ask a series of questions that will determine the shape, text, and colors of the logo in the SVG file that will be generated.
