# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

I was tasked with creating a Node.js app that generates an SVG file of a simple logo using inquiries that collects data from the user. I used Node.js and Inquirer along with Jest for testing.

## Installation

In order to install this app, you would clone the [repository](https://github.com/MrMessyFace/svg-logo-maker) from GitHub. After you have cloned the repository, you would type "npm i" into the terminal to install the NPM packages. After the packages are installed, you would type "node index.js" into the terminal to start the app.

## Usage

When a user starts the app, the terminal would ask a series of questions that will determine the shape, text, and colors of the logo in the SVG file that will be generated.
